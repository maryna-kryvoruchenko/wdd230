        <h4 class="example-title">White Space and Clean Design</h4>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="headings">Apple <br><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a></div>
          <img src="images/apple_screenshot.jpg" alt="Apple Website" />
          <p class="desription">Apple shows an excellent example on how to work with white space. The design is very clean and it's easy for the user 
              to see what the company presents. In this instance, the company uses this principle to be as clear as they can 
              on the new product they are trying to sell. This principle, also, works well with contrast because when the developer uses 
              white space - it's more simple to add a contrasting image and such.

      <div class="examples">
        <h4 class="example-title">Proximity</h4>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="headings">Samsung <br><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung.com</a></div>
          <img src="images/samsung_screenshot.jpg" alt="Samsung Website" />
          <p class="desription">Samsung.com follows the rule of proximity. This design principles helps the user to see how each element
              of the content is related to each other. In the example above, we see that the text stays together, the icons
              have its own place and each is placed together with the rest of them. Proximity hepls the user navgigate around 
              the page better.

      <div class="examples">
        <h4 class="example-title">Fitt's Law</h4>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="headings">Walmart <br><a href="https://www.walmart.com/">Walmart.com</a></div>
          <img src="images/walmart_screenshot.jpg" alt="Walmart Website" />
          <p class="desription">Including the Fitt's Law into webpages is beneficial because that means the user is able to find 
              the wanted information in a short period of time. Although this principle is mostly about how fast 
              it takes the visitor to move from one link to another, in the mobile version - if the links are too 
              far apart from each other, the user gets impatient and leaves the website. This example shows that the 
              links are positioned in the locations, where it wouldn't take long to navigate around.
