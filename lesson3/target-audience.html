        <p>The target audience of this website is people with different age groups and interests. Here are two personas
            that would explain it better: <br><br>

            1) Julia - Julia is a fifteen year old high schooler that enjoys science. She has always been interested in the environment 
            and different effects of it. In the future Julia would like to focus on the topic of global warming, 
            therefore she decided to track the weather through a long period of time to see how much it affects the situation.
            The student will gather as much information as the website will provide in order to have accurate research data. <br><br>

            2) Robert - Rob is thirty seven and he is a traveler. He has visited hundereds of famous places in the world. However, 
            he has his favorites. From this website he hopes to receive proper information regarding weather to plan accordingly for 
            his next trip. Rob also enjoys hiking and photography, so he will focus not only on temperature, but air quality and wind levels as well. <br><br>

            Here are several different scenarios that would help us understand the goal of the website better:<br><br>

            1) What is the weather/temperature for today and what should I expect tomorrow?<br>
            2) Will there be any form of precipitation today? <br>
            3) Are the wind levels strong enough that I have to cancel my plans? <br>
            4) I would like to know the weather for the whole week because of my trip. <br>
            5) What is the air quality and how is it compared to a week ago? <br>
